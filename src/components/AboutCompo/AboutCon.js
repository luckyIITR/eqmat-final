          This conference is organized as part of celebrations to commemorate
          175 years of Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (erstwhile
          University of Roorkee). The conference aims to cover the recently
          observed emergent phenomena in the area of quantum materials. These
          materials pose the most exciting and challenging research problems in
          condensed matter physics. The scope of quantum materials is very
          broad. Focus of the conference will be on the most recent challenges
          like quantum topology, quantum magnetism, low-dimensional electronic
          systems, multiferroic materials, superconductivity, quantum phenomena
          at the artificial interfaces and in the engineered materials.

          These systems show unusual novel properties with potential application
          for development of future electronic, spintronic and storage devices
          with better capabilities. Recently new experimental and theoretical
          techniques have been developed to investigate the complex properties
          of quantum materials. Techniques based on resonant x-ray
          spectroscopy/scattering, pump-probe techniques and spin resolved
          photoelectron spectroscopy have provided new insight into the
          properties and exciting problems of the quantum materials. Advanced
          theoretical techniques such as dynamical mean field theory (DMFT),
          time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) etc. have been
          developed recently and are being used very successfully to understand
          extremely complex properties of these systems. This conference shall
          provide a common platform to exchange ideas and identify cutting edge
          problems.
